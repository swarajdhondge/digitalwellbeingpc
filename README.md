## 🎛️ PulsePanel

**PulsePanel** is a lightweight wellness app for Windows (and soon macOS/Linux) that helps you understand and balance your digital habits. It tracks your **screen time**, **app usage**, and **audio exposure**, while gently nudging you with break reminders to protect your eyes, ears, and mind.

Designed for **focus**, **minimalism**, and **privacy**, PulsePanel runs silently in the background and gives you a clear view of your daily digital “pulse.”
