Track your digital rhythm.

## 🎛️ PulsePanel

PulsePanel is a lightweight wellness app for Windows (and soon macOS/Linux) that helps you understand and balance your digital habits. It tracks your screen time, app usage, and audio exposure, while gently nudging you with break reminders to protect your eyes, ears, and mind.

Designed for focus, minimalism, and privacy, PulsePanel runs silently in the background and gives you a clear view of your daily digital “pulse.”
